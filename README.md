# Binary-Search-Tree
BST written in C. Let's see how fast I can write this. 

Project Description
======

Attention students,

Youâ€™ve been recruited by ACME Solutions to help with developing a prototype for their new personnel management system.  Each of you will develop an implementation for the core functionality of the system along with a few additional features to demonstrate that it is operating correctly.  

Github links to obtain the following will be distributed via the course mailing list. 

- an empty repository to fill with your lab
- a repository initialized with demo code (see below) 


Requirements
============

Your implementation should aim to accomplish the following:

- Store the names of all the employees in the company.
  - This data should be structured using a binary search tree..

- Provide a simple user interface so that a user may:
  - Add a new employee name
  - Remove an employee name
  - List all employee names

- Read and write employee names to and from a file. 
  - in a manner that preserves the BST's structure.
  
Your source code should be logical, well commented, and include a readme file on how to operate the program.  You may collaborate with each other; however, if you obtain a piece of code from an outside source (i.e. anything not written by you) that performs anything more than a trivial mathematical expression, you must document where you found it.  

Due Date and Grading Criteria
=============================

You will demo your lab to the TA during the following week.  Expect to be asked to checkout your project from your rep, compile it, explain how your code works and be able to perform a live modification.  Your will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Tools (efficiently utilize bash, emacs, make, the compiler, and git)
- Written Communication (appropriate documentation)
- Mature Programming (proper code hygiene, appropriate algorithms, modularization, header files)
- Variable Allocation (appropriate use of variables, scope, allocation)
- Subroutine Linkage & Separate Compilation 

Please refer to the Grading and Course Learning Outcomes webpage for an in depth explanation of the grading criteria.

Getting started: Linked List Demo
=================================

We have provided a "linked list demo" to help enure that you are familiar with pointers, structures, and what's expected of a "professional" code delivery.  We encourage you to examine it carefully.

Its contents are described in a README.  That readme also suggests a few practice problems that you should consider attempting prior to starting this lab.
